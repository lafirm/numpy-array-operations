# Most useful (5) Numpy Operations for beginners!

### These are the 5 Numpy Operations which you need to know, if you're a beginner.

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source core Python library for scientific computations. It is a general-purpose array and matrices processing package.
The below are the list of functions which will be discussed in detail:

- sort()
- count_nonzero()
- argmax()
- linalg.eig()
- diag()

## Functions: 
  ### 1. sort()
  Sorting function `np.sort` in Numpy is used to sort the elements present in an array in ascending order.

  ### 2. count_nonzero()
  `np.count_nonzero()` in Numpy package is used to count the number of non zero elements present in the given array

  ### 3. argmax()
  `np.argmax()` in Numpy package is used to find the indices of the maximum values along a particular axis.

  ### 4. linalg.eig()
  `np.linalg.eig()` function is used to find the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square matrix

  ### 5. diag()
  `np.diag()` function in Numpy package is used to extract the diagonal value of an array along a particular axis or create a diagonal array with the given elements.
